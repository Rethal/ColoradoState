Raytracer

To compile: make
To recompile: make over
To clean: make clean

To run: 
raytracer <scene.txt> <output.ppm>
#scene should be appended with a number 1-4 to use example scenes
raytracer
#this will provide a 1024x1024 version of the masterwork image

#NOTICE: please use masterwork1.ppm for grading.  It is 4098x4098 and the scene is
#significantly easier to see and comprehend at this size.  Running raytracer
#is simply there to provide a smaller copy and prove that masterwork1 came from this code
