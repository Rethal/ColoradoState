1: 1 sentence: What goes in the /var directory on a UNIX computer?
/var contains variable data, cached data, log files, and various other files of data
that the system writes to while it is running.

2: 1 sentence: What is the /dev directory for on a UNIX computer?
The /dev directory contains "device files" which I interpret as drivers for various
devices (from floppies to USBs) that connect to the computer.

3: On your experimental node, find out how large the disks are and how much space is free. Put
this information in a separate file called top_secret/diskfree.txt. (See the 
infobox on command redirection for an easy way to do this.)


4: On your experimental node, find out the "vendor id" of the experimental node's CPU model.
-Hint: there is a dynamic file on the system that includes this information.
