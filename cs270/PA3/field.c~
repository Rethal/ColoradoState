/** @file field.c
 *  @brief You will modify this file and implement six functions
 *  @details Your implementation of the functions defined in field.h.
 *  You may add other function if you find it helpful. Added functions
 *  should be declared <b>static</b> to indicate they are only used
 *  within this file. For example, methods you write may need a mask value.
 *  You might write a method to compute a mask for you and use it wherever
 *  it is needed as opposed to just putting the code in line.
 *  These additional <b>static</b> functions are similar to Javaâ€™s private methods.
