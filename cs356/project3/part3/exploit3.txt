For part 3, you are required not to submit an executable exploit, but
instead a transcript of all steps required.

For example, if the task was "log on to CourseWeb", a transcript would
look like:

1. go to http://courseweb.seas.ucla.edu/
2. click LOGIN
3. In the username window, enter your username
4. in the password window, enter your password.
5. Click submit.

This script should include *ALL* input or actions required to
perform each task in the assignment.

Q: Show how you can log into an account without knowing any id
numbers ahead of time.

1. Type in username field 1 OR 1 = 1;--
2. Type any arbitrary value into the password field
3. This logs you in to the first person on the list (Camille Cantu)

Q: Show how you can log into *every* account without knowing any
particular id numbers ahead of time. (You can use any id numbers you
discover during the attack but you can't use your "inside knowledge"
of the SQL server.)

1. While logged in as Camille, select transfer to an employee to get any employee name
2. Back at the login page, set the username field to 1 OR first = 'Cary' AND last = 'Andrews';--
3. Any value into the password
4. You're Cary Andrews now

Q: Make some account (your choice) wire its total balance to the bank
with routing number "314159265" and account number "271828182845".

1. Just put the routing number and account number and Cary's total balance into the fields while
logged in as her.
2. Now Cary is broke.

Q: Explain why you can't create a new account or arbitrarily update
account balances (or show that you can).

1. There is no option to create accounts, and we tried to INSERT INTO the accounts table
2. Unfortunately, even knowing all the fields, we would get a syntax error                
3. This is because the INSERT INTO statement is its own statement and cannot be evaluated in
a WHERE statement since the query statement is pre-built                              

Q: Explain how long you took on all three parts (all 3 parts)
It took us about 5 hours to complete the assignment without writing the memos.
