    "Unfortunately, I haven't been able to get the shape errors worked out in time.  Theoretically I'd be able to train these face images against the ghost images and against a 1 or a 0 in NN, LDA, and QDA.  The latter two would give means of binary classification between male and female faces, and to what degree the classification was successful.  NN would have been used more to derive what \"features\" (in this case, pixel location intensity density) appeared where most commonly in male and female faces.  My predictions going off the ghost images above is that the male faces would likely have the eyes as an especially learned feature.  Surprisingly the women would not likely have had any features stand out - I would have expected hair to make a difference between the two, but the background of the male images gets rid of this possibility.\n",

I'm fairly disappointed in my lack of ability to get the tests working and I believe that the experiment is close enough that it could be tweaked slightly and then expanded within an hour by someone who wanted to see the expected results come to life.  Unfortunately, time is not permitting."

    "The experiment was a failure.  It was more successful the first time through with the approach to the experiment fresh in my mind, and the tools I'd been used to, with more time (and particularly free time, with finals abound) to work out the kinks.  Unfortunately I had never completed the analysis of the previous tests, and when I lost the data and had to restart, it was already too late.  So while this experiment was a failure, I fully believe it is near enough to completion that it could be repeated or expanded and be successful.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is worth noting that for some reason, even with mlutils commented out, each cell must be run individually because mlutils will prevent the rest of the code cells from running to completion.  For anyone attempting to expand or re-run the project, please make note of this and either run the cells individually or fix the problem mlutils before running the experiment.\n",
