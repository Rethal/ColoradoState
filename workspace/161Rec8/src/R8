	2^2



  4: How many bit strings of length seven either begin with two 0s OR end with three 1s?
	2^5+2^4-2^2



  5. How many people do you need in a room before you can guarantee that two people have names that start with the same letter?

	6*7



  8.  How many 6-character lowercase passwords are there, that begin with 'r' or end with 't'?
	26^5+26^5-26^4



  9.  How many cards must you draw before you are guaranteed to have two of the same suit?

  Challenge questions:
 
  10. How many people do you need in a room before you can guarantee that there are four from the same state? (there are 52 states)
	Assuming 52 states (there are 50), 157 (but it would really require 151), unless you're counting people not from here in which case you'd also have to add
	the entire popularity of the world that is not from America, plus 157 (151).

  11. How many cards must you draw before you are guaranteed to have a spade?
	40, if Jokers are removed

  12. How many cards must you draw before you are guaranteed to have two kings?
	50, if Jokers are removed

  13. An indoor soccer team is composed of 6 players and must have at least 3 girls.  
      If you have 5 girls and 7 boys to choose from, how many different ways are there to form a team?
	5c3*7c3+5c4*7c2+5c5*7c1
